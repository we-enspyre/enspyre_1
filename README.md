## Project Overview

This project serves as a robust starter template for building modern web applications. It combines several powerful technologies to streamline development and enhance productivity:

- **Vite** provides an extremely fast development environment with instant hot module replacement and optimized build performance.
- **TypeScript** adds static typing to JavaScript, helping catch errors early and improve code maintainability.
- **React** is used for creating dynamic, component-based user interfaces with a declarative approach.
- **shadcn-ui** offers a collection of accessible and customizable UI components, accelerating the process of building consistent interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS** enables utility-first styling, allowing rapid and responsive design directly within your markup.
- **next-theme** is integrated for easy theming and dark mode support, enhancing user experience across different environments.
Together, these tools create a solid foundation for scalable, maintainable, and high-performance web applications, making it easy to kickstart new projects with best practices and modern workflows.
